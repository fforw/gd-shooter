# Shooter

A very simple classic shooter game made with Godot 4.

Training wheels for my godot learning.

 * Moving, shooting player
 * Enemy with ability to explode on being shot
 * EnemySwarm that moves at an approximated equal distance step
 * Enemy ships that follow that target point and avoid each other in a 
   mini-boid-y fashion
